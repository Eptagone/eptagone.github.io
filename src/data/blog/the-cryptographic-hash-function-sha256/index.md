Hi people.
I would like to share with you a implementation of the SHA256 hash function in C# programming language. So that you can understand it more easily, I tried to make it as simple as possible and more faithful to what the document says. I know that for many people the algorithm can be complicated, but I assure you it is really very simple. :3

To call the function, do the following:

1. Move the sha256.cs file to your Visual Studio Project.
2. Open the file sha256.cs and change the namespace for your project.
3. Call funcion HashComputation
example:

```CSharp
Sha256 hasher = new Sha256();
byte[] hash = hasher.HashComputation(input)
```

...where input is the byte[] variable that you want to hash.

The RAR file contains two files:
A pdf document that explains the step by step sha-256 algorithm.
A C# code file, created using the information in the previous document.
If you prefer not to download anything, you can view the files online.
